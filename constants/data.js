So, I decided to create my own money tracker. 🚀
    
    This Fullstack project was an exciting challenge, especially since, although I've taken several backend courses, my main experience is in frontend. I chose a MERN stack, using MongoDB for the database, Express to set up the API, and React with Vite for the frontend. I'm really happy with the result. 😄
    
    Features included:
    - 📝 User registration and login.
    - 📊 Dashboard to load and view transactions, available for both registered and guest users.
    - 📈 Detailed income and expense charts.
    - 💳 Selection and creation of personalized cards with icons.
    - 🔍 Filtering transactions by category, date, and card.
    - ⬅️ Editing and deleting transactions with a simple swipe.
    - 📥 Import and 📤 export transactions to and from Excel files.

      🚀 After my experience with iframes in my last "image to code" project, I had the idea of creating my own web editor similar to CodePen and CodeSandbox. The vision: a tool where I could quickly and efficiently test snippets of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without the need to create or install files.
      
      💡 The first phase of the project was surprisingly smooth, thanks to the knowledge gained from my previous experience with iframes. But I decided to take it a step further by integrating my favorite IDE, Visual Studio Code, into the editor.
      
      ✨ The result has exceeded my expectations. As you can see in the attached image, I managed to replicate Google's homepage within my web editor, a small but significant achievement that reflects the project's capabilities.

      🚀 Recently, I updated my personal landing page, which features my resume. Inspired by the Windows 10 aesthetic, I aimed to give it an original and unique touch. This idea came after watching a video by Miguel Ángel Durán García showcasing a personal portfolio styled like Windows 98 by Eric Selva.
      
      🔄 From Next.js to Astro
      
      I had the opportunity to explore Astro, a framework that caught my attention for its performance and efficiency. Initially, my portfolio was developed in Next.js. Despite using techniques like lazy loading and skeletons, I faced performance issues and a less-than-smooth user experience.
